# PriceChecker
cs591 final project for Peter Gilbert and Alex Thomas

In order to run the code you need to run our fusion file or import our scrapealchemy library that is included in this project. You can specify in the fusion file which spider you want to run and it should automatically adapt to a new spider. Currently relationship support is not added.
